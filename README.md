# FlownCoop

In 2019 I created this draft of a website to help students in the Milwaukee Public School District log community service hours.
Unfortunatly bureaucracy killed this dream before the first group of tester got try it. I taught myself some php and html basics
and wrote this entirely from scratch. It now lives here for me to occasionally mess with it and for passers by to see.
